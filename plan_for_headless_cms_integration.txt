Headless CMS Integration Plan for Your Current Static Website

Information Gathered:
- Your current app is a static multi-section HTML website with content hardcoded in HTML.
- Sections include About Us, News, Events, Team, Contact, etc.
- Content is currently not dynamic or editable by non-technical users.

Recommended Free Headless CMS Options:
1. Netlify CMS (Git-based)
   - Open source, free
   - Works well with static sites
   - Content stored as markdown or JSON files in your git repo
   - Editors modify content via a friendly UI, changes committed to git
   - Requires hosting on Netlify or similar with git integration

2. Sanity.io (Hosted)
   - Hosted backend with generous free tier
   - Flexible content modeling
   - Content fetched via API (GraphQL or REST)
   - Requires some frontend code changes to fetch and render content dynamically

Plan (Focusing on Netlify CMS Integration):

1. Setup Netlify CMS:
   - Add a `admin` folder with `index.html` to serve the CMS UI
   - Add a `config.yml` file to configure collections (content types) matching your site sections (About Us, News, Events, Team, etc.)
   - Configure backend to use your git repository

2. Content Migration:
   - Convert existing static content into markdown or JSON files in the repo under a `content` folder
   - Structure content files according to collections defined in `config.yml`

3. Frontend Changes:
   - Modify your HTML/JS to fetch content from the markdown/JSON files dynamically
   - Use a static site generator or client-side JS to render content from these files

4. Deployment:
   - Host your site on Netlify (free tier)
   - Netlify CMS will handle content editing and commit changes to your repo
   - Changes will be reflected on your site after rebuild

Dependent Files to Edit:
- Add `admin/index.html` and `admin/config.yml` for Netlify CMS
- Add `content/` folder with markdown/JSON content files
- Modify main HTML files and JS to fetch and render dynamic content

Follow-up Steps:
- Test CMS login and content editing
- Verify content updates reflect on the live site
- Train content editors on using Netlify CMS UI
