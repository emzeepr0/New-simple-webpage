AfriRIGHTS is a Pan-African think tank working to ensure that business practices in Africa respect and uphold human rights. Despite advances in the promotion and protection of human rights, Africa, as arguably one of the fastest growing economies in world, is grappling with numerous legislative, regulatory, policy and institutional challenges that hinder the effective realization of business-related human rights.

AfriRIGHTS is committed to serving as a catalyst in advancing and promoting the interconnectedness of business and human rights across Africa. Through partnership with African Union, national governments and partners, AfriRIGHTS strives to shape an Africa where businesses adopt rights-centric and responsible profit-making practices as a corner stone to sustainable development.

As a Pan-African non-profit organization, AfriRIGHTS depend on support from a wide range of partners who share in the commitment of respect for human rights in the context of business practices. They include international organizations, governments, private foundations and businesses. Importantly, any funding received from businesses must be unconditional and must respect the independence of integrity of AfriRIGHTS' work. 

AfriRIGHTS is registered as a charity in the United Kingdom and as a company limited by guarantee with the Corporate Affairs Commission in Nigeria. Efforts are also underway to secure additional registration across other African countries, further strengthening its continental presence.
