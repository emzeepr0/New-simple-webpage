description: |
  AfriRIGHTS and the Nigeria National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has perfected a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate in the thematic area of Business and Human Rights (BHR). As part of the partnership both institutions will co-host the First National Colloquium on Business and Human Rights, along with a series of follow-up activities. The Colloquium will be organized under the theme “Promoting Participatory and Responsible Business Practices in Nigeria” and will convene and congregate a nationwide audience of leading business actors and human rights stakeholders. The colloquium will be structured to achieve the following outcomes:
  - Sustain ongoing momentum and offer a dynamic national multi-stakeholder platform for policy coherence and dialogue on the implementation of the NAP on Business and Human Rights.
  - Generate the buy-in of business enterprises in Nigeria to integrate the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights into their governance, policy frameworks and practices.
  - Sensitize national regulatory institutions on the need to strengthen extant legislative frameworks and oversight capacities to ensure right-centric and responsible business in Nigeria.
  - Share group and community experiences of the necessity to respect the human rights of Nigerians in the informal economy, particularly those at heightened risk of business-related human rights abuses.
  - Broaden partnership and promote mutually reinforcing collaboration and networking opportunities between and among governments, businesses, NHRC, investors, civil society organizations (CSOs), academia, human rights defenders, and other stakeholders.
  - Exchange and learn from positive practices and challenges, including those linked to the implementation of the NAP and other key trade agreements and regulations, including the AfCFTA, the EU Deforestation Regulation and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.
