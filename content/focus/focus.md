heading: "Our focus"
description: "As NORMS, we focus on addressing structural barriers to sustainable development, especially those inherent in policies, legislation, and institutional mechanisms. In addition, we pay key attention to barriers in human rights and development, particularly those confronted by civil society, business enterprises, rights-holders, and human rights defenders. Therefore, we seek to bring about norms-consistent behaviours by stakeholders in four interlinked areas."
