As a Pan-African non-profit organization, AfriRIGHTS depend on support from a wide range of partners who share in the commitment of respect for human rights in the context of business practices. They include international organizations, governments, private foundations and businesses. Importantly, any funding received from businesses must be unconditional and must respect the independence of integrity of AfriRIGHTS' work.
