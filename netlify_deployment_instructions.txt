Step-by-Step Instructions to Deploy The Site on Netlify and Configure Netlify CMS UI Access

1. Create a Git Repository
   - Push the website code (including the admin folder and content folder) to a Git repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

2. Sign Up / Log In to Netlify
   - Go to https://www.netlify.com/ and sign up for a free account or log in if you already have one.

3. Create a New Site from Git
   - In the Netlify dashboard, click "New site from Git".
   - Connect your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
   - Select the repository containing the website code.
   - For a static site, you can leave the build command empty if you are not using a static site generator.
   - Set the publish directory to the folder containing the site (e.g., root or `public` if applicable).
   - Click "Deploy site".

4. Enable Netlify Identity
   - In the site dashboard, go to "Settings" > "Identity".
   - Click "Enable Identity".
   - Under "Registration preferences", choose "Open" or "Invite only" depending on your preference.
   - Save the settings.

5. Enable Git Gateway
   - Still under "Identity" settings, scroll to "Services" and enable "Git Gateway".
   - This allows authenticated users to commit changes to your Git repository via the CMS.

6. Configure Netlify CMS
   - Ensure the `admin/config.yml` is correctly set up with the backend as `git-gateway`.
   - The CMS UI will be accessible at `https://your-site.netlify.app/admin/`.

7. Invite Users (if using Invite Only)
   - In the Identity tab, invite users by email who should have access to edit content.

8. Access the CMS UI
   - Navigate to `https://your-site.netlify.app/admin/`.
   - Log in with your Netlify Identity credentials.
   - You can now edit content via the CMS UI, and changes will be committed to your Git repository.

9. Content Updates
   - After content changes, Netlify will trigger a site rebuild and deploy the updated site automatically.

Additional Notes:
- For local testing, you can run a local server and access the CMS UI at `/admin/`.
- For more advanced setups, consider adding build commands if using static site generators.
